# 📊 Explainable Credit Intelligence Platform  
*Built for CredTech Hackathon (IIT Kanpur, 2025)*  

---

## 📖 Overview  
Traditional credit ratings are **infrequent, opaque, and lagging**. Our solution is a **real-time, explainable credit scorecard** that ingests structured financial data and unstructured signals (news, transcripts, sentiment) to generate **dynamic, transparent, and evidence-backed creditworthiness scores**.  

The platform provides:  
- **Real-time insights** through continuous data ingestion  
- **Transparent credit scoring** with explainability layers  
- **Analyst-friendly dashboards** for better decision-making  

---

## 🎯 Features  

✅ **Data Ingestion & Processing**  
- Real-time ingestion of structured (finance APIs, filings) & unstructured (news, sentiment) data  
- Data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction  
- Fault-tolerant & scalable pipelines  

✅ **Adaptive Scoring Engine**  
- Creditworthiness scoring with interpretable models (Decision Trees, XGBoost + SHAP)  
- Incremental learning & frequent retraining support  

✅ **Explainability Layer**  
- Feature importance breakdowns  
- Event-driven adjustments (e.g., *“Company X restructures debt → Score decreases”*)  
- Plain-language summaries for analysts  

✅ **Interactive Dashboard**
